    body: `Dear HRD/Hiring Manager at **{{COMPANY}}**,

I am writing to formally submit my application for the **{{POSITION}}** role at **{{COMPANY}}**. I am **{{NAMA}}**, an Engineering graduate and a certified General OHS Expert (Ahli K3 Umum - Kemnaker RI).
My engineering background has cultivated a strong analytical mindset essential for precise risk assessment. Furthermore, my field experience in geophysical surveys has provided me with practical exposure to site hazards and operational dynamics. This hands-on understanding, reinforced by my OHS certification, equips me with the core competencies to effectively execute Hazard Identification (HIRADC), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), and ensure rigorous regulatory compliance on-site.

Please find attached my CV, competency certificates, and supporting documents for your review. I am fully prepared to be deployed to any project location as required by the company.
I look forward to the possibility of an interview to discuss how I can bring value to **{{COMPANY}}**'s safety objectives.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
**{{NAMA}}**
{{KONTAK}}
